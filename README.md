# What this checks
This self-check focuses on five must-know decision signals:
Timing of insights — before vs after decisions
Automated vs manual risk detection — proactive or reactive
Real-time visibility into portfolio trade-offs
AI-driven recommendations vs static dashboards
Clear ownership for acting on AI-generated insights

# Why this matters
Reports describe the past. Decisions shape outcomes.
As AI becomes embedded in delivery and portfolio workflows, PMOs must move beyond reporting and enable timely, accountable decisions. This self-check helps leaders quickly identify where decision support is breaking down.
